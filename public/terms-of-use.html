        The site is provided on an "as-is" and "as available" basis, and company
        and our suppliers expressly disclaim any and all warranties and
        conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory,
        including all warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
        particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or
        non-infringement.  We and our suppliers make not guarantee that the site
        will meet your requirements, will be available on an uninterrupted,
        timely, secure, or error-free basis, or will be accurate, reliable, free
        of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe.  If
        applicable law requires any warranties with respect to the site, all
        such warranties are limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the
        date of first use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
        the above exclusion may not apply to you.  Some jurisdictions do not
        allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
        limitation may not apply to you.

        data, costs of procurement of substitute products, or any indirect,
        consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages

        from or related to this agreement, will at all times be limited to a
        maximum of fifty U.S. dollars (u.s. $50). The existence of more than one
        claim will not enlarge this limit.  You agree that our suppliers will
        have no liability of any kind arising from or relating to this
        agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability

      <h2>Copyright Policy</h2>

      <p>
        Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users
        of our Site do the same.  In connection with our Site, we have adopted
        and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the
        removal of any infringing materials and for the termination of users of
        our online Site who are repeated infringers of intellectual property
        rights, including copyrights.  If you believe that one of our users is,
        through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a
        work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the
        following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to
        17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>
          identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been
          infringed;
        </li>
        <li>
          identification of the material on our services that you claim is
          infringing and that you request us to remove;
        </li>
        <li>sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;</li>
        <li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
        <li>
          a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
          objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
          agent, or under the law; and
        </li>
        <li>
          a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
          under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the
          copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized
          to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation
        of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the
        complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s
        fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
        allegation of copyright infringement.
      </p>

      <h2>General</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any
        substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the
        last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting
        notice of the changes on our Site.  You are responsible for providing us
        with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last
        e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid our dispatch of
        the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
        notice of the changes described in the notice.  Any changes to these
        Terms will be effective upon the earliest of thirty (30) calendar days
        following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30)
        calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our
        Site.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our
        Site.  Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall
        indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound
        by the terms and conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please
        read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract
        with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for
        MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and
        disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or
        service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in
        small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
        individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless
        otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
        English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and
        to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in
        interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
        unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under
        the Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
        Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
        the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
        basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to
        the Company should be sent to: 221B Baker Street. After the Notice is
        received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
        dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or
        dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either
        party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement
        offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
        after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which
        either party is entitled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated
        through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative
        dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this
        section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree
        to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider
        shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such
        rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration
        Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by
        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted
        by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total
        amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
        $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
        arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or
        disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
        Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
        determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a
        location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside
        of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you
        reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
        reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
        court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award
        that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
        you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the
        greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs
        and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal
        share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong>
        If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
        conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
        submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
        the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal
        appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
        parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration,
        the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
        statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
        Rules for the pertinent claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated,
        the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the
        Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters
        or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have
        the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. 
        The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and
        to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
        under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator
        shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
        essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  The
        arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
        that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator
        is final and binding upon you and the Company.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
        CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
        FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and
        disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
        Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
        efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are
        subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation
        should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court
        in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
        AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that
        the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and
        disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be
        arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis,
        and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
        litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or
        user.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration
        proceeding shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to
        maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This
        paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law
        any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
        arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration
        Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall
        be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
        Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and
        limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the
        party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive
        or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will
        survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either
        you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing,
        either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
        federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. 
        A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
        rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and
        Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s
        patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to
        this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits
        the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to
        the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands
        County, California, for such purposes.
      </p>

        to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to
        export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S.
