## Reporting a Vulnerability

PRIOR TO SUBMITTING SECURITY CONCERNS/REPORTS:

1. Research Wikipedia and other sources about hackathons to become more familiar with the potential uses of this project, the intended settings, and usage environments.
2. Read README.md entirely, including the introduction and the steps for obtaining API keys, which includes replacing the .env values. The provided values in the .env file are placeholders, not a batch of keys exposed through GitHub.
3. Read PROD_CHECKLIST.md. Hackathon projects are not production projects, and this checklist is to help users with their next steps to move from a prototype state to a production state.

SUBMITTING SECURITY CONCERNS/REPORTS:

1. Complete the above steps 1 to 3.
2. If you still believe you have identified an issue, please submit it as a GitHub Issue at https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/issues with the relevant information for discussion and clarification.
   Submissions requiring registration with third-party websites will be marked/reported as spam.
