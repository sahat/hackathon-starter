The device config options are: Role, Serial Output, and Debug Log. Device config uses an admin message sending a `Config.Device` protobuf.

## Device Config Values

### Role

Sets the role of the node.

Acceptable values:

|      Value      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `CLIENT`     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 Client (default) - This role will follow the standard routing rules while also allowing the device to interact with client applications via BLE/Wi-Fi (Android/Apple/Web).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  `CLIENT_MUTE`  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Client Mute - Same as a client except packets will not hop over this node, does not contribute to routing packets for mesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|    `ROUTER`     |                                                          Router - Mesh packets will prefer to be routed over this node. The assumption is that Router-type devices will be placed in locations with a height/range/antenna advantage, and therefore have better overall coverage. This node will not be used by client apps. The BLE/Wi-Fi radios and the OLED screen will be put to sleep. Please note: Due to the preferred routing, this role may cause higher power usage due to more frequent transmission.                                                           |
| `ROUTER_CLIENT` |                                                                                                                                                                              Router Client - Hybrid of the Client and Router roles. Similar to Router, except the Router Client can be used as both a Router and an app connected Client. BLE/Wi-Fi and OLED screen will not be put to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   `REPEATER`    | Repeater - Mesh packets will prefer to be routed over this node. This role eliminates unnecessary overhead such as NodeInfo, DeviceTelemetry, and any other mesh packet, resulting in the device not appearing as part of the network. As such, direct messaging this node is not available, as it will not appear in your nodes list which results in a cleaner mesh network. Channel and modem settings of the mesh packets being repeated must be identical to the repeater's configuration. Please see Rebroadcast Mode for additional settings specific to this role. |
|    `TRACKER`    |                                                                                                                                                                                   Tracker - For use with devices intended as a GPS tracker. Position packets sent from this device will be higher priority. Smart Position Broadcast will default to the currently configured settings. When used in conjunction with power.is_power_saving = true, nodes will wake up, send position, and then sleep for position.position_broadcast_secs seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|    `SENSOR`     |                                                                                                                                                                                               Sensor - For use with devices intended to primarily collect sensor readings. Telemetry packets sent from this device will be higher priority, broadcasting every five minutes. When used in conjunction with power.is_power_saving = true, nodes will wake up, send environment telemetry, and then sleep for telemetry.environment_update_interval seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Rebroadcast Mode

This setting defines the device's behavior for how messages are rebroadcasted.

|        Value        |                                                                                      Description                                                                                      |
| :-----------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        `ALL`        |   ALL (Default) - This setting will rebroadcast ALL messages from its primary mesh as well as other meshes with the same modem settings, including when encryption settings differ.   |
| `ALL_SKIP_DECODING` |                      ALL_SKIP_DECODING - Same as behavior as ALL, but skips packet decoding and simply rebroadcasts them. **Only available with Repeater role.**                      |
|    `LOCAL_ONLY`     | LOCAL_ONLY - Ignores observed messages from foreign meshes that are open or those which it cannot decrypt. Only rebroadcasts message on the nodes local primary / secondary channels. |

### Serial Console

Acceptable values: `true` or `false`

Disabling this will disable the SerialConsole by not initializing the StreamAPI.

### Debug Log

Acceptable values: `true` or `false`

By default we turn off logging as soon as an API client connects. Set this to true to leave the debug log outputting even when API is active.

### GPIO for user button

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the user button, if your device does not come with a predefined user button.

### GPIO for PWM Buzzer

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the PWM buzzer, if your device does not come with a predefined buzzer.

### Node Info Broadcast Seconds

This is the number of seconds between NodeInfo message broadcasts from the device. The device will still respond ad-hoc to NodeInfo messages when a response is wanted.

### Double Tap as Button Press

This option will enable a double tap, when a supported accelerometer is attached to the device, to be treated as a button press.

### Managed Mode

Enabling Managed mode will restrict access to all radio configurations via client applications. Radio configurations will only be accessible through the Admin channel. To avoid being locked out, make sure the Admin channel is working properly before enabling it.

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set device.role CLIENT --set device.debug_log_enabled true
```

:::

```shell title="Set the role to client"
meshtastic --set device.role CLIENT
```

```shell title="Disable serial console"
meshtastic --set device.serial_enabled false
```

```shell title="Enable debug logging"
meshtastic --set device.debug_log_enabled true
```
