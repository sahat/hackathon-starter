## Prerequisites

In order to set up your local environment, you will need to install:

- [Node.js Runtime](https://nodejs.org)
- [PNPM Package Manager](https://pnpm.io)

## Getting Started

### Fork the Meshtastic Repository

Log into GitHub and create a fork of the [meshtastic/meshtastic](https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic) repository.

### Clone your Meshtastic Repository fork

:::note
Replace `username` with your GitHub username.
:::

```shell title="Clone username/Meshtastic Repo"
git clone https://github.com/username/meshtastic.git
```

### Change directory to Local copy

```shell title="Change Directory"
cd ~/meshtastic
```

### Install Dependencies

```shell title="Install dependencies using Yarn"
pnpm i
```

### Run Development Server

```shell title="Run node.js server"
pnpm start
```

:::tip
Before submitting a pull request, it's helpful to run the following command to ensure there are no broken links or errors:

```shell title="Build Project"
pnpm build
```

## Update Local Repository

### Verify Upstream Remote is Set

```shell title="Check Remote and Upstream Repositories"
git remote -v
```

If it's set, skip to [Align with meshtastic/meshtastic Master branch](#align-with-meshtasticmeshtastic-master-branch)

#### Update/Set Upstream if it isn't configured properly

If upstream exists, set the URL:

```shell title="Update Upstream Repository"
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic.git
```

If upstream doesn't exist, add the URL:

```shell title="Add Upstream Repository"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic.git
```

### Align with meshtastic/meshtastic Master branch

:::caution
This will delete any unfinished work. Make sure that you've saved and committed any work you wish to push up to your fork.
:::

:::info
The following command assumes the clone of your Meshtastic fork is in the home directory (`~/meshtastic`). Adjust the path to the correct path on your machine.
:::

```shell title="Rebase local Meshtastic to remote Meshtastic"
cd ~/meshtastic ; git fetch upstream ; git checkout master ; git rebase upstream/master
```
