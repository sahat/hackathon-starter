Meshtastic documentation is an important ingredient to the overall project. We want users to hit the ground running with the information they need right at their finger tips. This section will discuss the documentation software stack, file organization, and style guides.

## Software Stack

All of our documentation resides on GitHub. Instructions for setting up your GitHub account are located [here](/docs/development/reference/github).

Our documentation is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) — a documentation platform built on React that utilizes markdown files. Because markdown files are easy to edit, most content changes should be fairly simple.

Another component that we use is [Vercel](https://vercel.com) — a platform for front-end frameworks and static sites. Instructions for setting up your instance of Vercel are located [here](/docs/development/documentation/publish#publish-to-vercel).
