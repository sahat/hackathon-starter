## Build instructions

If you would like to develop this application we'd love your help! These build instructions are brief and should be improved, please send a PR if you can.

1. Use Android Studio to build/debug
2. Use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull in the various sub-modules we depend on.
3. There are a few config files which you'll need to copy from templates included in the project. Run the following commands to do so:
   ```shell
   rm ./app/google-services.json
   cp ./app/google-services-example.json ./app/google-services.json
   rm ./app/src/main/res/values/curfirmwareversion.xml
   cp ./app/special/curfirmwareversion.xml ./app/src/main/res/values/
   ```
4. Now you should be able to select "Run / Run" in the IDE and it will happily start running on your phone or the emulator.

:::note
The emulators don't support Bluetooth, so some features can not be used in that environment.
