A python release consists of publishing the release to PyPi https://pypi.org/project/meshtastic/ as well as producing single-executable files that are downloadable from Github https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python/releases.

#### Pre-requisites

No pre-requisites are needed locally to make a release. All builds are done via Github Actions currently.

To test/validate, you will need to run:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

```shell

```

- run unit tests: `pytest` (optional)

- run bin/test-release.sh (optional)

- Run the "Make Release" workflow in Actions: https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python/actions/workflows/release.yml
