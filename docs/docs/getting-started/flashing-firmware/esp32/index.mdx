## Flashing Method for ESP32 Devices

1. The [Web-Based Installer](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/web-flasher.mdx) requires either Chrome or Edge browsers but is an excellent choice for quickly flashing devices. **This method is highly recommended for firmware flashing, especially for new users of the project, as it is easy to use.**
2. The [CLI Script](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/cli-script) is considered the "manual process" for flashing firmware.
3. Flashing your device using an [external serial adapter](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/external-serial-adapter) should only be attempted as a last resort if no other method has been successful.

:::info note

The [web client](http://localhost:3000/docs/software/web-client) at meshtastic.local is only updated with a full wipe and reinstall of the device. If you choose a reinstall, you will get the latest (bundled) web interface.  To preserve your settings, you may [export your configuration](../../../software/python/cli/#--export-config) prior to a reinstall and load them back after.
