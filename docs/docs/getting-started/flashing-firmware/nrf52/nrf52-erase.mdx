Meshtastic uses the [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) library to store configuration, logs, and other data in the internal flash of nRF52 devices. Updating the firmware does _not_ erase this additional data, which can cause issues when the format and location of data changes between releases.

To reset the flash storage on your nRF52 board:

Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).

1. Connect your device to your computer with a USB data cable.
2. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode)
3. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
4. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
5. Copy the included file named `Meshtastic_nRF52_factory_erase.uf2` onto the virtual disk device. The device should reboot.
6. Connect to the device via serial console using the [Meshtastic CLI `--noproto`](/docs/software/python/cli/#--noproto) mode or a standalone serial client like `minicom`.
7. Press any key, you should see the message: `Formatting... Done`.

Once the device has been erased, you can proceed to install the latest Meshtastic firmware on a clean storage filesystem by clicking the link below.
