## Flashing Methods for nRF52 Devices

The nRF52 based devices have the easiest firmware upgrade process. No driver or software install is required on any platform.

### Drag & Drop
nRF52 devices use the [Drag & Drop](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop) installation method to install firmware releases.

### Over-The-Air (OTA)
nRF52 devices are able to accept [OTA firmware updates](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/ota) from a mobile device over bluetooth.

### Factory Erase
You may wish to perform a [Factory Erase](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/nrf52-erase) prior to installing firmware to clear data that may change format and location between releases.

### Convert RAK4631-R to RAK4631
If your device did not come with the Arduino bootloader you will need to [perform the conversion](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/convert-rak4631r).
