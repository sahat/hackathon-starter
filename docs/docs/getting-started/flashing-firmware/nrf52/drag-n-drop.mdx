## Flash Firmware

Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).

1. Connect your device to your computer with a USB data cable.
2. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode)
3. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
4. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
5. Drop the appropriate firmware file (`firmware-DEVICE_NAME-x.x.x-xxxxxxx.uf2`) from the release onto this drive.

Once the file has finished copying onto the drive, the device will reboot and install the Meshtastic firmware.

## Connect and Configure Device

After flashing the Meshtastic firmware to the device, you can proceed with the initial configuration.

### Potential Flashing Edge Cases

:::info

Before flashing confirm that you have [RAK4631](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/) and not a [RAK4631-R](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/) If this is not the case, fear not. The hardware is identical but requires changing the bootloader. Instructions on how to do this are located [here](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/convert-rak4631r).

:::

:::info

Previous versions of the Meshtastic firmware may save stale data, causing devices to get stuck in a crash loop during startup. If you experience issues when upgrading your nRF52 device from a previous version of Meshtastic, you may need to perform a full factory reset of the internal flash memory.

Follow the guide to [factory erase your nRF52](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/nrf52-erase) device before continuing to [flash firmware](#flash-firmware).
