### Test Serial Driver Installation

You can verify that you have a proper data cable (rather than a charge-only type cable) and that the appropriate drivers for your system are installed by performing the following test:

<Tabs
groupId="operating-system"
defaultValue="linux"
values={[
{label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
{label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
{label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

1. Connect your Meshtastic device to your USB port
2. Open a **Terminal** and enter the following command:

   ```shell
   lsusb
   ```

3. You should see something like:

   ```shell
   ID xxxx:xxxx Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge
   # or
   ID xxxx:xxxx QinHeng Electronics USB Single Serial
   # or
   FIXME (WISBLOCK OUTPUT)
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

1. Navigate to `Apple Menu  > About This Mac > More Info > System Report... > Hardware > USB`.
2. You should see similar to one of the following entries:

- `CP210X USB to UART Bridge Controller`
- `CH9102 USB to UART Bridge Controller`
- `WisCore RAK4631 Board`
- `USB Single Serial`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

1. Navigate to `Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)`
2. You should see similar to one of the following entries:

- `Silicon Labs CP210X USB to UART Bridge (COM5)`
- `Silicon Labs CH9102 USB to UART Bridge (COM5)`
- `USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH9102 (COM5)`
- `USB Serial Device (COM5)`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you are unable to see your device:

- Make sure that your cable is not only for charging but also for [data transfer](/docs/getting-started/#verify-data-cable).
- It's possible that you need to [reinstall the USB serial driver](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers).

## Flash Firmware

After completing the previous steps, you can now flash the Meshtastic firmware onto your device. To proceed, select the appropriate device type for your device.
