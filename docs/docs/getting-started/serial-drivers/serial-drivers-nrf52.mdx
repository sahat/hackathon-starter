## Install nRF52 USB to Serial Drivers

:::caution

nRF52 devices typically do not require serial drivers. They use the UF2 bootloader which makes the devices appear as flash drives.  Do _NOT_ download the USB device drivers unless required to install UF2 support.

:::important

After installing the driver, make sure to reboot your computer to finish the installation process.

You can also [test your serial driver installation](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/test-serial-driver-installation) at this step if required.

:::

### Flash Firmware

After installing the serial drivers, you can now flash the Meshtastic firmware onto your device. To proceed, select the appropriate device type for your device.
