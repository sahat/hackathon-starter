<TabItem value="IO">

The [RAK13002 IO Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-interface/products/adapter-module-rak13002) can be used to, among other things, add a user button to the RAK base boards (excluding the RAK19003 Mini base board). It features a number of different interface options:

- 2x I<sup>2</sup>C interfaces
- 2x UART interfaces
- 1x SPI interface
- Upto 6x GPIOs
- 2x ADC interfaces
- 3.3v Power rails

There is development activity in progress to get sensors such as this added to the Meshtastic Core.
