## Installation Methods

Our Android application is available on our F-Droid repo and Google Play Store. This allows you to connect to your Meshtastic device from your Android phone.

The minimum Android version is 5.0 (Lollipop 2014, first BLE support), however Android 6 (Marshmallow 2015) is recommended as Bluetooth is more stable.
