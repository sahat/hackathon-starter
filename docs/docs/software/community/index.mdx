The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible, and a number of community projects have been made to fit different people's needs. If you wish to create your own application or module, please read the information in the developers section, and tell us about your project on the forum.

Current community projects:

- [ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit) Forwarder](/docs/software/community/community-atak) - An ATAK plugin for forwarding CoT messages via a hardware layer which supports Meshtastic devices.
- [Meshtasticator (Simulator)](/docs/software/community/community-meshtasticator) - Meshtasticator is a discrete-event and interactive simulator that mimics the radio section of the device software.
- [Meshtastic Web API](/docs/software/community/meshtastic-web-api) - Meshtastic Web API provides a RESTful interface to interact with a Meshtastic node via a serial connection.

Support for these projects should be sought from their respective authors.
