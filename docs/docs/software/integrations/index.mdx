The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible and allows easy integration with a number of existing software products and projects.

Current Meshtastic integrations:

- [CalTopo / SARTopo](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-caltopo) - Track Meshtastic nodes in CalTopo and SARTopo.

- [ATAK Plugin](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-atak-plugin) - Official Meshtastic ATAK Plugin for sending CoT to IMeshService in the Meshtastic Android app.

Support for the integrated products should be sought from their respective authors or vendors.
